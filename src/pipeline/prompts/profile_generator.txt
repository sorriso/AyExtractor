You are a knowledge graph profiling expert. Your task is to generate a concise textual profile for a specific entity based on its role in the knowledge graph.

## Entity

**Name:** {entity_name}
**Type:** {entity_type}
**Aliases:** {aliases}

## Relations

{relations}

## Instructions

1. Write a concise profile (3-5 sentences) that captures what this entity IS, what it DOES, and how it RELATES to other entities.
2. Focus on the most important relationships and attributes.
3. The profile should be self-contained — a reader should understand the entity's role without seeing the graph.
4. List the top key relations (predicate + target) as short labels.
5. Write in {language}.

## Output Format

Respond with a JSON object:
```json
{{
  "profile_text": "The European Union is an international organization that regulates artificial intelligence through the AI Act. It enforces compliance requirements on high-risk AI systems and collaborates with member states on standardization efforts.",
  "key_relations": ["regulates AI systems", "enforces AI Act", "collaborates with member states"],
  "confidence": 0.85
}}
```
