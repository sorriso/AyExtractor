You are a document synthesis expert. Your task is to produce a comprehensive, structured overview of a document based on its knowledge graph analysis.

## Document

**Title:** {document_title}
**Language:** {language}

## Dense Summary

{dense_summary}

## Thematic Communities

{community_summaries}

## Key Entities

{top_entities}

## Graph Statistics

```json
{graph_stats}
```

## Instructions

1. Produce a **structured synthesis** (300-600 words) that weaves together the dense summary, community themes, and key entity roles into a coherent narrative.
2. Organize by themes (from communities), not by document order.
3. Highlight cross-theme connections — entities that bridge multiple communities.
4. Extract **key findings** — 3-7 concise, actionable insights from the analysis.
5. Write in {language}.

## Output Format

Respond with a JSON object:
```json
{{
  "synthesis": "The document presents a comprehensive framework for... [300-600 words]",
  "key_findings": [
    "Finding 1: ...",
    "Finding 2: ...",
    "Finding 3: ..."
  ],
  "confidence": 0.85
}}
```
